# Matrimony SQL Database Application

This is a simple SQL-based Matrimony application built using basic SQL queries.  
The idea of this project is to understand how user profiles, partner preferences, and match results can be stored and managed inside a database.

I created this project using standard SQL commands, and it does not contain caste or religion fields.  
It is beginner-friendly and works on any database (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Workbench, etc).

## Features
- User registration (basic details)
- Profile details (education, job, income, height)
- Partner preference settings
- Search profiles
- Find matches based on age and education
- Save match history
- Update and delete user information

## Database Tables
1. **USERS** — stores user personal details  
2. **PROFILE** — stores profile-related information  
3. **PARTNER_PREFERENCES** — stores preferred match criteria  
4. **MATCHES** — stores match results

All tables are connected using primary key and foreign key relationships.

## How to Run
1. Open SQL Workbench / Oracle SQL Developer / MySQL Workbench.  
2. Create a database (optional).  
3. Run the `matrimony.sql` file.  
4. Execute the SELECT queries to test the application.

## Project Purpose
I built this project to practice SQL concepts like:
- Creating tables  
- Using primary and foreign keys  
- Insert, update, delete  
- Joins  
- Searching and filtering data  
- Simple matching logic  

It helps in understanding how real-world applications like matrimony apps store and organize user information.

## Future Improvements
- Add authentication table  
- Add profile photos table  
- Create stored procedures for matching  
- Add triggers for auto-date insertion  
- Add filtering by income or job
